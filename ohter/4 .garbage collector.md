# What's the garbage collector

In java, garbage means unreferenced objects.

Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically.In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.

# How can an object be unreferenced?

-  nulling the reference. Ex:
   ```Java
   Employee e = new Employee();
    	e = null;
   ```
-  By assigning a reference to another. Ex:

   ````Java
    Employee e1=new Employee();
    Employee e2=new Employee();
    e1=e2;//now the first object referred by e1 is available for garbage collection
   ```
   ````

-  By anonymous object:
   ```Java
   new Employee();
   ```

# `finalize()` method

The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected.
This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. This method is defined in Object class as:

# Example:

```Java
public class TestGarbage1{
public void finalize(){System.out.println("object is garbage collected");}
public static void main(String args[]){
TestGarbage1 s1=new TestGarbage1();
TestGarbage1 s2=new TestGarbage1();
s1=null;
s2=null;
System.gc(); // The garbage collector acts
```
