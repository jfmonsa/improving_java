# Concepts
* Object: a real world entity
* Class: bolierplate for objects (Collection of objects, logical entity)
* Inheritance: When objects acquires properties and behaviours of parent objects (Reusability, Extensibility) (extends)
* Poymorphism: One task is performed by different ways (Run time polymorphism) (1. function overloading and operator overloading)
* Encapsulation or  Data hiding: (data binding or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit, (base class can private some data) access specifiers (public, private and protected)
* Abstraction: Hiding internal detais and showing functionality: We use abstract class and interface to achive abstraction
* Message passing

# Encapsulation
Using acces modifiers

# Abstraction
In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.

## Polymorphism
Note: Polymorphism in Java is mainly of 2 types: 

Overloading
Overriding -> achives run time polymorphism

# Java
## Types of variables
* local variable
* instance variable (define in within a class itself)
* static variable
* constants (final)
## Types
* Widening or automatic type conversion, narrowing or explicit conversion
### Java Enum
Is a data type that contains fixed set of constants. It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY) , directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST)
etc. The java enum constants are static and final implicitly

## Arrays
Fixed size, sequential collection of elements ot the same tipe

Two ways of creting an array,the first:
1. declaring: `dataType[] var_name` and then initializing the array `arr_var = new dataType[size]`
2. the prev in one statement `dataType[] arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];`
