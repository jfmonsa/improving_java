# Wrapper class

provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types, reference data types contain useful methods, can be used with collections (ex: ArrayList)

In Java, non-primitive data types are known as reference types. In other words, a variable of class type is called reference data type. It contains the address (or reference) of dynamically created objects. For example, if Demo is a class and we have created its object d, then the variable d is known as a reference type.

It refers to objects. It is not pre-defined. It is created by the programmer if required. The reference types hold the references of objects. All reference types are a subclass of type java.lang.Object. It provides access to the objects stored in the memory.

| Primitive data type | Wrapper class |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| `bolean`            | `Boolean`     |
| `char`              | `Character`   |
| `int`               | `Integer`     |
| `double`            | `Double`      |
